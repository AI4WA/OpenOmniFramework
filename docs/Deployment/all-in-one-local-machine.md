# All in One Local Machine

It will be what we have introduced in the **Tutorial/setup** Section.

**Shared Access of the Files (videos, images and audios)**

Under this mode, all the files will be shared on the same machine via the docker volume and file system, so there is no
need to transfer the video and audio data between different machines, to ensure API/AI/Client all have access to the
files.
