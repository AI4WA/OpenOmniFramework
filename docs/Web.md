# Web Interface

It is written in React and Next.js.
We have not yet started developing the web interface.

The main functionalities of the web interface we are aiming for now are:

- Login and registration
- A public available page to evaluate the LLM models chatbot for general users
- A private chat page with history information
- Application Demos
    - Aged Care Dashboard

We will first focus on the login and chat interface.
